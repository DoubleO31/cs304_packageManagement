# cs304_packageManagement
The domain we choose is the package delivery system. We are going to integrate order information from different companies. This includes customers, delivery companies, packages and orders. Customers are divided into senders and receivers, they can be identified by names, addresses and phone numbers. Packages have attributes like item names, weight, size. Orders contain information of order number, date sent and received, number of packages, shipping address. Companies have unique name and address.  Using database allows multiple users to modify their own order information. There are two kinds of users in our application, customers and employees. Employees can check customers’ information, receive information, update order status, as well as send notification to customers. Customers are able to order and receive a delivery, change their personal information, track packages, request a specific date of delivery, etc. This project will be done using CS department’s oracle database and java, JDBC. We won’t use any special software or hardware.
